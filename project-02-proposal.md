# Project 2 Proposal

Project 2 has left many ideas floating around in my head. However, two ideas have stuck with me. I'm a huge fan of the Jurassic Park 
series, along with the Alien series (I want a pet Xenomorph), so I'm considered on of these two themes. If capable, I would have 
the Jurrassic landscape behind me, with dinosaurs roaming, or I'll go with my Alien theme. I hope to create a ship interior, accompained 
with a xenomorph. I just hope I can pull this off.
