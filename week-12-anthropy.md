# The Benefits of gaming

Video games have had some bad representation throughout the years. Its seems to be blame for the recent uprise
in violence. Games, such as, Call Of Duty (COD), Grand Theft Auto (GTA), and Mortal Kombat (MK) are just a few
well known examples used by politicians and law enforcerment for their agendas. However, study shows a different 
narrative. Video games have been proven to increase creativity, improve problem-solving skills, and increase reaction time.

According to the National Library Service, video games are said to increase creativity. There are many games out today that 
could help improve one's creativity. One game that comes to mind is the highly popular game MineCraft. Minecraft allows 
players explore a 3D generated world with infinite terrain. Players have unlimited resources to create as world they see fit. 
Players can modify the game to create new gameplay mechanics, items, and assets. This allows for an endless combinations of 
possibilties and creativity.

Improving problem-solving skills is an additional benefit from playing video games. The first game that comes to mind
is the classic game Tetris. Tetris is primarily composed of a field of play in which pieces of different geometric forms, 
called "tetriminos", descend from the top of the field. The objective of the game is to use the pieces to create as many 
horizontal lines of blocks as possible. When a line is completed, it disappears, and the blocks placed above fall one rank.
Tetris create forsight for the players when a tetrimino piece is presented. The brain registers the piece and scans 
the field for the right fitting of the piece. Thus, this action enhances one's problem-solving skills.

Lastly, video games can increase one's reaction time. According to the University of Rochester, "Playing action video games 
trains people to make the right decisions faster". Cognitive scientists from the University of Rochester stated that video games 
could provide a potent training regimen for speeding up reactions in many types of real-life situations. Rochester held an experiment 
were they took a total of 50 subjects between the ages of 18-25yr old. One half was given a fast pace game, such as Call of Duty, 
while the other half was given a slow pace game like the Sims. After this training period, all of the subjects were asked to make 
quick decisions in several tasks designed by the researchers. In the task, the subjects had to look at a screen, analyze what was 
going on, and answer a simple question about the action in as little time as possible. The Call of DUty players were up to 
25 percent faster at coming to a conclusion and answered just as many questions correctly as the Sims game players. This study helps
shed some light on the capabities and effects that video games can have on the individual.
