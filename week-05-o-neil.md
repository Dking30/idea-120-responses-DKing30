# Weapons of Mass Destruction

 "Weapons of Mass Destruction", by Cathy O'neil, provides context for “WMD”, throughout the reading. O’neil welcomes the reader into the problematic issues of big data. She provides insight to our technological advancements and how these advancements allow us to navigate into the future. Unbeknownst to the public, the major problems of big data are hidden from the public eyes, only to raise its ugly head in our near future.

In the read, O'neil speaks about a time where she had been paired up with a team of hackers/mathematicians. The NYPD had been utilizing data and technology to determine info for high risk neighborhoods for crimes. O’neil’s group had a job to do. They had to analyze the data from the stop and frisk procedures and see if these technologies and practices had a positive impact on the communities. To no one's surprise, O’neil’s findings display that people of color and low income families were hit harder by the Stop and Frisk movement. She found that this procedure (Stop and Frisk) landed many people of color in jail and in debt. 

In O’neil final statements, she presents an experience she had in Camden, New Jersey. The murder captiol of the country, 2011. She found that the neighborhoods in Camden, had been policing themselves, in an effort to lower the murder count. And, Camden has seen progress. With this step forward, Camden has rebuilt their relationship with law enforcement and has created arrest of the criminal as a last resort. She argues that this method of engagement towards crime could have possibly prevented the death of unarmed black men by the hand of an officer. Perhaps, if we look at Camden, New Jersey, as an example of moving forward, then, communities across the country could begin to rebuild their relationship with their officers.
