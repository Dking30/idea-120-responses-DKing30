# Creepy Internet

James Bridle's, "Something is Wrong On the Internet", touches on the troubles of the internet in relations to children.
Bridle's believes that the internet grants access to material that is inapporpriate even for a 13 year old. In addition, he provides 
information on just how many individuals are tunning into these weird "kids" shows, in comparison, to bots (a.i.) tunning 
into the the show.

James Bridle's position on the current state of the internet is accurate. The internet has create a space for both adult and child 
to become more relax and occupied (for the child's sake). I get it, parents want a break for being a parent temporarily. 
Kid Youtube provides peace and quiet around the house, and no mess to clean continously clean up. A parent just needs to pop on one 
of those highly saturated kid shows with some catchy tunes and the child is hooked. However, I find it very alarming that
number of views these shows are producing, can be seen as an indicator of just the many parents needing a break. Bridle suggests
that the high viewership related to these kid shows could also be generated by bots. With that being said, we could argue that 
a.i. are manipulating both the parent and child to click on specific channels for thier attention. 

This idea is pretty scary and alarming. A.I. controlling our viewership depicts humanity's future with the internet.
Although, these kid shows are beleieved to be harmless, some are just darn out weird, and I'm an adult. "Wrong Head, Wrong Ears" exposes
our youth to dismembered individuals and the swapping of body parts. Like, who comes up with these ideas for children?. 
Bridle's concerns are factural ones, and I agree. The internet is a scary place and parent should really research what they're introducing
into their children's lives.
