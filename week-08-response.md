# Personalized Ads

In the reading, "Weapons of Math Destruction: Chapter 4" by Cathy O'Neil, She disccusses the mind behind the advertisment.
The process of developing advertisement that best produces its higher outcome. During these processes, advertisement seems to
become a monsterous predator. O'Neil brings up for-profit organizations that prey on the weak-minded and low-esteem individuals. 
The educational market is highly profitable under the predatoral mindset of these advertisments.

Advertisment is everywhere. During my normal consumption of the internet, I'm bombarded with masses of advertisment.
Advertisment from for-profit colleges, art exhibitions, video games, and the latest in technology are a few ads to name. 
Although, it's great to be in the loop for information provided by ads, however, I how concerns on the personalizations for
these ads. The algorithms that saves and reports my internet searches, then presents advertisment for similar search 
subjects scares me. These a.i. methods have become so personal that it makes advertisment messages hard to get lost among 
the sea of online content. It has become more direct for the said individual. This kind of personalization reassures 
my suspicious of always been monitored by the eye in the sky. And I feel it is a sort of invasion of privacy.
