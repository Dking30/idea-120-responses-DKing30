# Project 4 Proposal

Project 4 is to make a portfolio website. The layout of my portfolio website will be simple.
The main index page with hold the 3 main project title's on the layout. I will incldue a fourth
project from outside of this class. The project titles will serve as a link to the specific project.
Once the individual select a title and the link opens up the project website, the individual will
see a description for the specific project, followed by the actual project.
