# Project 03 Proposal

For project 03, I have concluded to create a game. The core theme of the game will take place in a maze
with an objective of exiting the maze. The idea is to present the player with 3 initial pathways
to take when starteing. As the player proceeds through the paths, they are met with obstacles such as booby traps,
small questionaire, and in some case, no road blocks. Booby traps will slow down the player's approach to the exit
, however, missing a question from the questionaire will bring the player back to the begining of the maze. The "no road
block" paths will be a direct path to the exit. Lets play Maze Racer!
