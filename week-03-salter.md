# Understanding Gesamtkunstwerk 

<p>In the article, Entangled, Chris Salter reflects on the advantages of modern technologies. Some of these technologies include mechanics and electricity, which enhanced artistic performances during the earliest twentieth century. With these advantages, Salter coined the term Gesamtkunstwerk, which can be described as a rough translation of a "total work of art" and describes an artwork, design, or creative process where different art forms are combined to create a single cohesive whole. This conclusion came from Salter’s experience and observation of music, architecture, and design. 

This “total work of art” can be found most prominently in architecture. All aspects of the design; interior, exterior and furnishing were created to complement one another. In addition, a production team could be seen as a Gesamtkunstwerk. A director, a script writer, cameraman/women , and actors, are all complementing one another. This combination produces films and plays in which we enjoy. 

In today's times, the digital tools for media creation are plentiful. With the assistance of social media (which is a tool in itself), creators are creating Gesamtkunstwerk daily. Softwares such as Adobe Creative Suite, FaceApp, and Final Cut (to name a few), are today’s media art technologies that provide assistance in creating. An example of this would be R-U-IN?S / GARDEN CLUB, found in the Rhizome Anthology. The GARDEN CLUB uses the social media outlet Tumblr to post visual memes and photography that reaches out to other users. The feedback given from the other users creates more opportunity for the GARDEN CLUB to create and collab on those new idea. Thus, giving rise to Gesamtkunstwerk.<p>
